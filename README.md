# chatplots
Chat plots for destiny.gg given a username and  a month
Plotmaker is the main function and calls others
You have to send user and month as char; ex plotmaker(user = 'Talley76', month = 'August')
The files are saved locally so if it's hosted online you can just upload it or w/e
Currently plotmaker makes individualized filenames, but if I host onto a server i'll change that
